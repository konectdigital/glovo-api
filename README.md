# Glovo PHP Business API (Not Production Ready)

Glovo Business API Implementation.

## Requirements

PHP 7.2 and later.

## Composer

You can install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```bash
$ composer require konectdigital/glovo-api
```

## Dependencies

The bindings require the following extensions in order to work properly:

- [`curl`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php), although you can use your own non-cURL client if you prefer
- [`json`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)
- [`mbstring`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) (Multibyte String)

If you use Composer, these dependencies should be handled automatically. If you install manually, you'll want to make sure that these extensions are available.

## Getting Started

Create an account in Glovo (it can be created from the App). This api **needs a credit card associated to your account**. You can add one from your app and it will be used automatically for any order. In order to get your API credentials you should login in the desired environment and go to *Credentials* section on your profile.

* [B2B Sandbox/Test](https://business.testglovo.com/dashboard/profile)

Example ApiKey & ApiSecret:
```php
$apiKey = '125238463972712';
$apiSecret = '081f8c9680d457a088b4413a62ddf84c';
```

Simple usage looks like:

```php
<?php

include 'vendor/autoload.php';

use GlovoApi;
use Konectdigital\GlovoApi\Model\Order;
use Konectdigital\GlovoApi\Model\Address;


// get credentials on https://business.glovoapp.com/dashboard/profile or https://business.testglovo.com/dashboard/profile
$api = new GlovoApi( '125238463972712', '081f8c9680d457a088b4413a62ddf84c' );
$api->sandbox_mode( true );

$sourceDir = new Address( Address::TYPE_PICKUP, -34.919861, -57.919027, "Diag. 73 1234", "1st floor" );
$destDir = new Address( Address::TYPE_DELIVERY, -34.922945, -57.990177, "Diag. 73 75", "3A");

$order = new Order();
$order->setDescription( "1 big hammer" );
$order->setAddresses( [$sourceDir, $destDir] );
//$order->setScheduleTime( ( new \DateTime( '+1 hour' ) )->setTime( 19, 0 ) );

try {
    $orderEstimate = $api->estimateOrderPrice( $order );
    echo "Estimate: {$orderEstimate['total']['amount']}{$orderEstimate['total']['currency']} \n";
} catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}

try {
    $orderInfo = $api->createOrder( $order );
    echo "Order created, ID: {$orderInfo['id']}, state: {$orderInfo['state']} \n";
} catch(Exception $e){
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```
See full example in [example.php](example.php)
